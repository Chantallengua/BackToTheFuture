# BACK TO THE FUTURE

<p>
This project was developed for the "<b>Information Modeling and Web Technologies</b>" course of the Master Degree in <b>Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge</b> of the <b>University of Bologna</b>, a.y. 2018/2019. 
</p>
<p>
The main purpose is modelling an <b>interactive website</b> which displays ready-made /user-entered texts and images with <b>different typographic styles</b>, each inspired by a different <b>historical period</b>.
</p>
<p>
By simply clicking on any point of a <b>timeline</b>, the visitor can "travel through time" from the age of the Sumerians in 3200 BC, until the website of the future, in 2040. Our attention focused on some crucial points in the history of typography, which include the invention of the typewriter in 1878, the foundation of the <i>Bauhaus school of art, architecture and design</i> in 1919, the blooming of the artistic-cultural movement of the Pop Art in 1960, and the golden age of arcade video games in 1980.
